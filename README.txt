Because Intercity has since changed their website, the program no longer works. In their previous website, the URL queries were given ('From', 'To', 'Date'). In their new website, however, the URL queries are hidden and so such a program is no longer possible. As such, the code I have provided serves more of a historic purpose without any use, as a new Web Scraping program will extract the data in a very different way.

index.html and script.js are for my website, https://bus.zaidi.nz, which is still active where you can see a handful of results I found thanks to this application.

main.py allowed me to quickly sort through the information found in my scraping results, AKL-MNK-1.txt and  MNK-AKL-1.txt, which I then placed onto my website.

Web Scaper.py is the actual program, a no longer functional tool that allowed me to find cheap bus deals from across the country. I was able to take a trip around the country thanks to this app which almost all my trips being $1 NZD.
