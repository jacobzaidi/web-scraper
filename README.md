## About Web Scraper

Web Scraper was a tool that allowed me to extract data from an intercity bus company's website in order to find $1 deals between a given source and destination. When the tool was working I was able to travel throughout New Zealand predominantly on $1 tickets.

## And...

Because Intercity has since changed their website, the program no longer works. In their previous website, the URL queries were given ('From', 'To', 'Date'). In their new website, however, the URL queries are hidden and so such a program is no longer possible. As such, the code I have provided serves more of a historic purpose without any use, as a new Web Scraping program extracts the data in a very different way.
